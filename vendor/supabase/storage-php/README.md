# Supabase `storage-php`

PHP Client library to interact with Supabase Storage.

> **Note:** This repository is in Alpha and is not ready for production usage. API's will change as it progresses to initial release.


### TODO

- [ ] Support for PHP 7.4 
- [ ] Adjust response interface to be closer to `postgrest-php` so manual parsing of response payloads is not needed 
- [ ] Running unit and integration tests together results in test failures
